[Website Link](https://cabone01.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/)  
In this repo, a website was made with the link to it above. It was made to present and discuss graphs that were made from a bit over 500 rows of data. The data was gathered using OpenWeather API and the variables presented are the city's latitude, max temperature, cloudiness percent, humidity percent, and wind speed. Further explanations about what was compared and any possible trends that were found can be found on the website.
